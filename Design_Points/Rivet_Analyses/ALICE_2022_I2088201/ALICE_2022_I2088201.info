Description:
  'Hadronic resonances are used to probe the hadron gas produced in the late stage of heavy-ion collisions since they decay
  on the same timescale, of the order of 1 to 10 fm/$c$, as the decoupling time of the system. In the hadron gas, (pseudo)elastic
  scatterings among the products of resonances that decayed before the kinetic freeze-out and regeneration processes counteract
  each other, the net effect depending on the resonance lifetime, the duration of the hadronic phase, and the hadronic cross sections
  at play. In this context, the $\Sigma(1385)^\pm$ particle is of particular interest as models predict that regeneration dominates
  over rescattering despite its relatively short lifetime of about 5.5 fm/$c$. The first measurement of the $\Sigma(1385)^\pm$
  resonance production at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb  collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}= 5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector is presented
  in this Letter. The resonances are reconstructed via their hadronic decay channel, $\Lambda\pi$, as a function of the
  transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}$) and the collision centrality. The results are discussed in comparison with the measured yield
  of pions and with expectations from the statistical hadronization model as well as commonly employed event generators,
  including Angantyr and EPOS3 coupled to the UrQMD hadronic cascade afterburner. None of the models can describe the data.
  For $\Sigma(1385)^\pm$, a similar behaviour as $\text{K}^\ast(892)^{0}$ is observed in data unlike the predictions
  of EPOS3 with afterburner.'
